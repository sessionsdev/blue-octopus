                <p>Dear Mrs. Pettijohn,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>
                    Your letter reached me recently after several forwardings. I believe I can give you some of 
                    the information you desire.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When the tanks and other vehicles left camp to return to our lines a number of us rode the 
                    outside of the vehicles. Lt. Pettijohn drew the lead tank. A few miles from the camp, the 
                    column ran into a German roadblock. The first shot of a German bazooka struck the lead tank, 
                    killing four persons, your husband included. The others were 2 POW officers and an enlisted 
                    man from the rear of the column. It was pitch dark at the time, and I did not know where we 
                    were.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After several other occurrences I was recaptured with a few others and taken to a small town 
                    called Gillbeck (it is on the road from Hammelburg to Gemunden, about 7 kilometers south of 
                    Hammelburg). It is little more than a crossroads. The German in charge told me that there 
                    were four Americans there who had been killed in the fight the evening before. Then I 
                    realized that we had returned to the roadblock.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I took several enlisted men, borrowed some shovels, and went to bury them. I was able to 
                    identify them all positively. By the nature of their wounds I am certain all died instantly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We buried them near the junction of a little creek and the highway, making each grave with a 
                    cross with the name written in indelible pencil. The graves are very noticeable from the 
                    highway and will undoubtedly be found by units organized for that purpose. Nothing was 
                    removed from the bodies because I felt it would be more valuable on the body as an aid in 
                    identification.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As soon as I had the chance I turned over full details to two other officers with 
                    instructions to report the matter if they survived. I made a full report at Le Havre and 
                    later at the placement of the matter.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Lt. Pettijohn and I lived in the same room at Hammelburg for about 3 months. He was one of 
                    the definitely good people there and I grew to be very fond of him. We often spoke of you 
                    and looked forward eagerly to being reunited with you.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If your surmise that the date of your husband's death was on 28 March is correct, it was 
                    very early in the morning.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I wish I could say something to comfort you in your loss but words are inadequate. Please 
                    feel free to call on me at any time for any information you wish that I might have.

                    June 16, 1942</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Dear Strip & Family,</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>
                    I suppose that you have decided that I didn't intend to write to you. I'm sorry, but I have just kept putting it off. 
                    I have lost your address, & I am just hoping that you get this.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I suppose you have heard of this beautiful Florida — well, it isn't what it is cracked up to be. I suppose that it is ok, 
                    but I had much rather be in Texas. I haven't been around much down here to see if I like it — It cost too much to go anyplace. 
                    They are really after these soldier's dollars. It is very few of mine that they get I can tell you.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    How are all of you? How is Patricia Ann? Gosh, I would really like to see her. 
                    Mother sent me a picture of her, & I think she looks like me — Don't you? She sure is sweet. I suppose that Joyce & Bud are about grown. 
                    I would like to have a snapshot of them if you have one. I know they must have grown a lot, but I can't imagine what they look like. 
                    Joyce will be 16 in August — will Glen be 8 or 9 in December?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This camp down here sure is a big one — there is 168 sections in it and about a 100,000 men. 
                    Everywhere you go there are a thousand soldiers. I will be glad when this is all over. 
                    I don't think we will ever go across — sometimes I wonder if I'm going to get to be over there. 
                    Hitler is my meat — the Japs don't amount to much. I believe the war will be over by next spring — then I will be out of the army by the fall following that. 
                    As soon as I get out I'm going to start farming — I think I will have enough money. I'm going to do my best anyway.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So long for now — Write to me & I promise that I won't wait so long to write next time.

                    The body, which had been interred in Holland, was among those returned to the States aboard the ship Carrol Victory Nov. 15, later being moved to the Quartermaster Depot in Ft. Worth. It was brought to Stephenville by the Trewitt Funeral Home, which has charge of arrangements, with an official army officer escort. The body will remain at the funeral home until time for the services.

                <p>
                    Terrell Pettijohn, who was a football star while attending the local high school, joined Co. D, 142nd Infantry, 36th Division, the local unit of the Texas National Guard, in 1941, and moved to Brownwood, when it mobilized.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    He went to Florida and Massachusetts with the unit, and while the division was in Massachusetts, awaiting orders to go overseas, he was assigned to the officers' training school at Ft. Benning, Ga., where he received his commission.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    He was stationed at Camp Wolters, Mineral Wells, and in April 1943, while there, was married to Dena Clark, daughter of Wilbur Clark of Stamford, formerly of Erath County. Her father and Henry Clark of Stephenville are brothers.

                    Pettijohn was sent to Camp Maxey, Paris, and in September 1944 he left for overseas duty, going immediately to the front.

                    On Dec. 18, 1944, in Belgium, Lieutenant Pettijohn was taken prisoner by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was in two or more camps until March 28, 1945, when he was liberated from Hammelburg, Germany. It was a short time after his release on a road south of the town, somewhere between Hammelburg and Gemunden, that the Americans ran into a road blockade. The first shot from a German bazooka struck the lead tank and killed Lieutenant Pettijohn and three others, according to an account received by Mrs. Terrell Pettijohn from one of the lieutenant's companions who escaped.
